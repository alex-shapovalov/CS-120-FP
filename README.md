# Final Project

**Language Translator**

For my final project I created a simplified version of "Google Translate" using the "googletrans" python library and OpenGL. You input a language from a selection of languages and type your desired text in a typebox. When you are ready to translate, simply press "Go" and your translated text will appear in the bottom box.
